# Hello, I suppose
I'm khhs, but you can call be Jimmy.  
I'm a hobby software and game developer, who *somehow* manages to make somewhat functional code.

If you're looking for someone to hire, look a bit further. I'm not available.

Currently juggling on a number of projects, since I am an expert at starting and never finishing(how it tends to be),
but as of right now, focus seems to be on an RPG with it's own engine, that I most likely never will complete(private repo ðŸ˜Ž)

Other than that I am chipping away at a bunch of Minecraft clones in C++ and Java(going slowly) and a *Persona 4: Golden* playthrough(going great, thanks for asking).

I can orientate my way around C#, C, Python and Java in a fairly confident manner. I can also hack stuff together in C++, PHP, JS(*and TS*) and some other languages.

Oh and I really like Randall Munroe, Douglas Adams, and writing like I am speaking.
