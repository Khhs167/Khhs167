# Hello, I suppose
I'm khhs, but you can call be Jimmy.  
I'm a hobby software and game developer, who somehow manages to make somewhat functional code.

If you're looking for someone to hire, look a bit further, I'm not available.

Currently juggling on a number of projects, since I am an expert at starting and never finishing(how it tends to be). 
But as of right now, focus seems to be on my lil' minecraft clone(you can find it under minecraftnt-java), and also a game with it's
own engine, that I most likely never will complete.

Other than that I am chipping away at a small OS(going slowly) and a *Persona 5 Royal* playthrough(going great, thanks for asking).

I can orientate my way around C#, C, Python, Java in a fairly confident manner. I can also hack stuff together in C++, PHP, JS(and TS) and some other things.

Oh and I really like Randall Munroe, Douglas Adams, and writing like I am speaking.
